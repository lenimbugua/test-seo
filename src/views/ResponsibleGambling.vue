        3. Self-Exclusion
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For a few customers, gambling might become a serious problem. We offer a
        self-exclusion option that can be easily implemented by a customer's
        request.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        To self-exclude from accessing our products, follow the steps below:
      </p>

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <p>
            Please contact us via email:
            <a href="mailto:care@hakibets.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">
              care@hakibets.com
            </a>
            and give clear written instructions of the self-exclusion measure
            and the period of exclusion you would like implemented on your
            account. We offer the following period(s) of exclusion:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
            <li>14 days</li>
            <li>1 month</li>
            <li>3 months</li>
            <li>6 months</li>
            <li>1 year</li>
            <li>2 years</li>
            <li>5 years</li>
            <li>Permanent exclusion</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Ensure that in your written request you have provided proof that the
            mobile number, which is a unique identifier for your account, is
            registered in your name by the mobile services operator. We retain
            the right to request any such due diligence documents for the
            purposes of ascertaining proof of account ownership.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Where the above information and documentation has been received by
            us, then your account may be suspended within a period of 12 hours.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Once you send a request for self-exclusion, we will endeavor to
            suspend your account as quickly as possible; however, any bets
            placed prior to the suspension of your account shall continue to be
            in place, and any winnings will be credited into your account as
            soon as the event is settled.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Once self-excluded, you will not be allowed to register a new
            account. Where a new account belonging to a self-excluded customer
            is detected, it will be suspended and closed immediately. Any
            winning bets in the new account after the existing account is
            self-excluded shall be voided and shall be considered a Prohibited
            Act under our General Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Hakibets reserves the right to exclude a customer for a longer
            period at our discretion. This may include instances where Hakibets
            is informed by legitimate sources or the requesting customer has
            cited addiction issues (e.g., regulators, other authorities,
            authorized professional organizations, authorized medical
            professionals, etc.) that may warrant an extension of a customer’s
            self-exclusion period.

        4. Recognizing Gambling Addiction
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Gambling should be seen as entertainment, not a way to make money or
        resolve financial difficulties. Be aware of signs of gambling addiction,
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Gambling with more money or time than planned.</li>
        <li>Borrowing money to continue gambling.</li>
        <li>
          Neglecting personal or professional responsibilities due to gambling.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, we strongly
        encourage seeking professional help.
