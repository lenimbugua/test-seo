    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold py-3">9. SELF-EXCLUSIONS</h2>

    <p>
      For a few customers gambling might become a serious problem. We offer a
      self-exclusion option that can be easily implemented upon customer's
      request.
    </p>
    <p>To self-exclude from accessing our products:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
      <li>
        Please contact Customer Services via email: hello@Hakibetsbets.com and
        give clear written instructions of the self-exclusion measure, and the
        period of exclusion you would like implemented on your specific account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you send your request for self-exclusion, make a withdrawal of
        funds from your Hakibets wallet to your mobile wallet.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is our policy not to suspend or exclude any accounts before all
        available funds have been withdrawn from the account or Hakibets wallet
        in question.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that in your written request you have provided a copy of your
        national ID, full names and the mobile number used to register your
        Hakibets account. In your self-exclusion request, you will need to
        declare that the mobile number, which is a unique identifier for your
        account, is registered in your name by the mobile services operator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where the withdrawal has been effected and all the above information and
        documentation has been received by us, then the account may be suspended
        within a period of five (5) business days after all the Background
        Checks have been completed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The customer ought to be diligent to ensure that the withdrawal has been
        made from their Hakibets wallet and all the information and
        documentation above has been sent in full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the self-exclusion application is made by you, you are advised not
        to place any bets as that would rescind the existing application. Any
        running bets placed prior to self-exclusion applied will continue to be
        in place and any winnings will be credited into your account as soon as
        the event is settled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Access to account and our games and services will be restricted
        throughout the self-exclusion period.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will endeavor to effect self-exclusion requests within the shortest
        period business of their receipt, during which period we will undertake
        due diligence on the account activity and make inquiries with mobile
        money service providers, the National Police Service, the Betting
        Control and Licensing Board, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission,
        the Financial Reporting Centre, and the Unclaimed Financial Assets
        Authority among other relevant competent government authorities. This
        due diligence exercise applies to all self-exclusion requests and may
        delay the turnaround time for effecting such requests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we have many requests, for instance during peak seasons such as
        international football seasons, there may be delays in processing your
        application for self-exclusion. We encourage you, in any event, to
        engage the Responsible Gaming options and meet a counsellor to assist in
        your gambling journey.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <span class="font-extrabold">Automatic lapse:</span>
    <p>
      Where 6 months lapse with no transactions in Your account, Your account
      will lapse automatically. The automatic lapse shall only be rescinded by
      any positive action to transact or place any bets using Your respective
      Hakibets account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once self-excluded, you will not be allowed to register a new account. Any
      request for a new account during self-exclusion period in force will be
      declined. Where a new account belonging to a self-excluded customer is
      detected, it will be suspended and closed immediately. Any transaction you
      undertake within the new account after existing account is self-excluded
      would be voided, may be considered a Prohibited Act under our General
      Terms and Conditions and stake returned and you will be notified
      accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the self-exclusion period requested by You, the
      self-exclusion feature will remain in place and continue to be in force
      for a minimum of seven (7) years, unless you take positive action to
      gamble again by requesting the exclusion to be removed and/or the account
      to be re-activated.
    </p>

    <p>
      You MUST contact Customer Services by email only after the period has
      expired in order to re-activate and to re-gain access to the account and
      be able to place bets. Any other requests (other than by email) will not
      be considered (You will be requested to send a written request after the
      request via telephone has been made).
    </p>

    <p>
      Hakibets reserves the right to exclude a Customer for a longer period at
      our discretion. This may include instances where Hakibets is informed by
      legitimate sources (e.g., regulators or other authorities, authorized
      professional organizations, authorized medical professional etc.) that may
      warrant extension of a customer’s self-exclusion period.

    <p class="">Events Beyond our Control</p>

    <p>

      control including, without limitation:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>

      <li>Epidemic or pandemic;</li>
      <li>

      <li>
        Any law or any action taken by a government or public authority,

        consent;
      </li>
      <li>
        Collapse of buildings, fire, explosion, or accident; and interruption or
        failure of utility service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Provided it has complied with this agreement, if a party is prevented,
      hindered, or delayed in or from performing any of its obligations under
      this agreement by a Force Majeure Event (Affected Party), the Affected
      Party shall not be in breach of this agreement or otherwise liable for any
      such failure or delay in the performance of such obligations. The time for
      performance of such obligations shall be extended accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding obligations of the other party will be suspended, and
      its time for performance of such obligations extended, to the same extent
      as those of the Affected Party.
    </p>

    <p>The Affected Party shall:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the Force Majeure
        Event, but no later than 7 days from its start, notify the other party
        in writing of the Force Majeure Event, the date on which it started, its
        likely or potential duration, and the effect of the Force Majeure Event
        on its ability to perform any of its obligations under the agreement;

        Majeure Event on the performance of its obligations.

    <p>
      If the Force Majeure Event prevents, hinders, or delays the Affected
      Party's performance of its obligations for a continuous period of more
      than four (4) weeks, the party not affected by the Force Majeure Event may
      terminate this agreement by giving thirty (30) days written notice to the
      Affected Party.

    <p>

      effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any
      subsequent right or remedy.
    </p>

    <p>
      A failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided
      under this agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or
      any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict any further
      exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
    </p>

    <p>
      No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under this

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold py-3">27. PALPABLE ERRORS</h2>
    <p>
      While every effort is made to ensure there are no errors or omissions in
      respect of our products and services, the nature of human error or system
      problems means such circumstances may arise. A non-exhaustive list of
      “obvious errors” is outlined below:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-decimal pl-6">
      <li>
        Odds or terms of a bet or game wager have been misquoted as a result of
        human error (for example, information being inputted incorrectly, or
        markets being set up incorrectly) or due to computer malfunction;
      </li>
      <li>
        A bet is accepted at a price or market condition which is significantly
        different from those available in the market at the time the bet was
        placed;
      </li>
      <li>
        In the context of normal betting business, and the probability of the
        event occurring, a bet is accepted at a price which is obviously
        incorrect;
      </li>
      <li>
        Bets have continued to be accepted on a market which should have been
        suspended, or the market has already closed, or has been postponed,
        which are sometimes referred to as “late bets”;
      </li>
      <li>
        The amount of winnings, returns or promotional benefits or bonuses paid
        to you are miscalculated as a result of human error or computer
        malfunction;
      </li>
      <li>
        Where winnings are so obviously incorrect or materially different to
        those available in the market that this is a clear error or omission
        e.g., the price is recorded as 100-1 or the margins for handicap betting
        have been reversed;
      </li>
      <li>An error has resulted from Prohibited Acts;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In accordance with product rules, where a bet should not have been
      accepted, and If such circumstances arise, we reserve the right (and at
      our sole discretion) to cancel the bet and either:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-decimal pl-6">
      <li>
        Correct the error on the bet placed and resettle the bet at the correct
        price or terms which were (or should have been) available to Us when the
        bet was placed; or;
      </li>
      <li>
        Declare the bet void and return the stake to Your account where
        correction is not reasonably practicable.;
      </li>
      <li>
        Take any further reasonable steps and actions deemed necessary by
        Hakibets to remedy the error, loss, or damages that Hakibets stands to
        suffer as a result of an error leading to an incorrectly accepted bet.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If funds are incorrectly credited to your account as a result of an error
      or omission (or otherwise any sum is incorrectly credited to your
      account):
    </p>

    <ul class="list-decimal pl-6">
      <li>
        You are obligated to notify us as soon as reasonably possible and in any
        event in no more than four (4) days;
      </li>
      <li>
        We reserve the right to deduct or reverse any incorrectly applied funds
        from your account. Where such funds have been withdrawn by You, We may
        demand that you make a full refund to Us and may take other recovery
        measures such as automatically debiting Your account whenever it has a
        positive balance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you use incorrectly credited funds to place bets, we reserve the right
      to void all such related bets and reverse any winnings.
    </p>

    <p>If incorrect stakes are deducted from your account:</p>

    <ul class="list-decimal pl-6">
      <li>
        You are obliged to notify us as soon as reasonably possible and in any
        event in no more than four (4) days;
      </li>
      <li>
        We reserve the right to void all such bets and reverse any winnings;
      </li>
      <li>
        If bets are placed using winnings related to bet(s) on which incorrect
        stakes were deducted, we reserve the right to void such bets placed and
        reverse any winnings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In respect of any reversals, if no such funds are available in your
      account to make good any funds deficit resulting from the reversal (for
      example, where the funds have been withdrawn by you), we reserve the right
      to recover such funds from you (with interest at market rates) on demand.
      If necessary, we are permitted to off-set any subsequent amounts you
      deposit or win with us to make good this liability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Errors relating to Prohibited Acts will be handled in accordance with
      clause 11 of these terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      We shall not be liable for any loss of winnings (or other loss) following
      errors or omissions by us or you.
